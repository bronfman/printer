Printer
===========

Tools for exploring the possibilities of "internet of things" printing.

Getting Started
---------------





Software Setup
-------------

The server acts as a conduit for turning HTML-based designs into a format suitable for the printer. The printer periodically polls the server, and if some data for printing is available, it downloads it and prints it.

Ruby 1.9

(You may need to add multiverse sources to apt - see http://askubuntu.com/questions/59890/ttf-mscorefonts-installer-is-not-available)

apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer xfonts-100dpi xfonts-75dpi xfonts-scalable xfonts-cyrillic redis-server imagemagick libmagick++-dev

Build PhantomJS by following http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/wiki/BuildInstructions

(TODO - configuring and designing)


TODO & CAVEATS
----

The printer itself seems to prefer some types of paper over others, particularly where dark printing or horizontal lines are present. I've experienced paper from Staples jamming. If I find any good sources of paper, I'll update this.

Rasterisation of HTML designs isn't great at the moment; to some extent this is limited by [PhantomJS], which:

* doesn't support web fonts
* doesn't seem to support non-antialiased rendering
* doesn't match the exact font-sizes as seen in the browser, and this doesn't seem to be consistent either.
